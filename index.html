				<p class="text"><img src="images/dhruv.jpg" width="500" height="300" class="floted-img"> Currently I am pursuing Mobile application design and development in Lambton college. During my academic year I have learnt how to design app for android and iOS using Swift, Java and have a good knowledge on database systems SQLite dB Room.I started off my career as an android developer intern with Create Solutions where I was involved in creating a health app. My involvement included working with frond end development and handling database systems. We achieved our goal of providing health solutions on fingertip for consumers. And from this experience I gained more knowledge on programming tools and database systems.After that, I acquired more skills on front end development while I was at the position of Front-End Developer at E2M Solutions. Over there, my duty was to constantly update website as per client’s needs. In addition to that I do possess great communication skills and have a motivated and innovative mindset while working on my tasks.I am aware of this position requires a person who is fast learner, has strong problem-solving skills and can perform duties like Development of Software, Scheduled Maintenance of Software and databases. And someone who has good knowledge on Software Development Lifecycle.  Overall due to my strong background in Software Development and my abilities of being a fast learner with a problem-solving mindset I am confident that I’ll be able to succeed in this role.
